"""The thought view — the registry door onto the ``kind='thought'`` rows (§4.1).

lm-27n.6 wires the typed :class:`~lifemodel.domain.objects.Thought` end-to-end
*without generation*: it persists as ``kind='thought'`` memory records (state
machine ``active``/``parked`` → terminal ``resolved``/``dropped``/``expired``/
``merged``) and RENDERS the live ones into the being's proactive wake packet.
Unlike the desire/intention/relationship singletons
(:mod:`lifemodel.core.desire_view` et al.), a thought is **NON-singleton** —
there can be many live at once — so this view reads and orders a *set*.

This module is the ONE place that reads those rows back into typed
:class:`Thought`s and the sole constructor of a thought, so every "what am I
turning over" site asks the SAME question — the **live non-terminal** thoughts
(``active``/``parked``), most-salient first. Two readers, one predicate,
mirroring the other views:

* :func:`live_thoughts` reads the start-of-tick records snapshot
  (:attr:`~lifemodel.core.component.TickContext.objects`) — what cognition
  renders into the wake packet in-tick;
* :func:`read_live_thoughts` reads a :class:`~lifemodel.ports.memory.MemoryPort`
  point-in-time — what the debug view's "what am I thinking" audit uses.

Every write goes through :func:`build_thought` → :func:`encode_thought` (the
registry encode door) — NEVER a hand-built draft. Ids are **deterministic**
(:func:`thought_id`/:func:`seed_thought_id`), never random: the real
generation-time id policy is a later task; here a reproducible content-digest
seed keeps re-seeding idempotent (one row, not a pile of duplicates).

**Behavior-neutral until a thought exists (lm-27n.6):** with no live thoughts,
:func:`live_thoughts` returns ``()`` so the wake packet adds no block and the
prompt is byte-identical to before.
