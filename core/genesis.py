"""Genesis — the being's birth (Phase 4, spec §5/§6).

Birth is an explicit ACT, never a set of dataclass defaults. ``State``'s defaults
double as the fallback for keys missing from older state files (``State.from_dict``),
so they mean "field not filled in", not "the body of a newborn". Nobody had ever
chosen the latter — which is why, until now, a being spoke the first words of its
life from ``quiet — even and very quiet``.

Hermes-free: this module knows nothing of the host.

    """The body a being is born with — computed from its own affect model.

    Two axes are chosen on principle:

    - **Valence is 0.0.** Our own ambient cue instructs the being "do not perform a
      warmth you do not feel". A being that has not met anyone cannot feel warmth
      toward them; issuing it at birth would make its very first act a performance.
      Valence is EARNED in the ritual — if the human turns out to be warm, it rises
      within minutes, and that first warmth is real.
    - **``u`` is 0.0.** The drive models a contact deficit inside an EXISTING
      relationship. A newborn has none: there is nobody to miss. Birth is not longing.

    Arousal is not chosen at all — it is *evaluated*. The affect model targets
    ``0.15 + 0.45·circadian + 0.20·energy`` (``core/affect.py``), i.e. ``0.35`` at the
    circadian trough and ``0.80`` at its peak. A hardcoded constant would therefore be
    a lie within the hour: a being "born calm" at noon would simply drift up to 0.80.
    So the newborn is placed exactly where its own physiology says it already is — it
    is a FIXED POINT, nothing drifts, and the result means something true: **being born
    at three in the morning is not the same as being born at noon.**
