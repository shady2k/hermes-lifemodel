"""Suppression spans — first-class observability for "why did it NOT happen" (spec §5).

The lying egress outcome that relabeled a quiet tick as a false "session busy" is
replaced by a **suppression-span**: a structured log event, emitted from inside the
deciding component's child span (or minted at the egress boundary), that carries a
CLOSED ``reason`` code naming the gate that silenced the tick. Silence stops being
the absence of a record — a quiet tick is as debuggable as a loud one.

The reason set is a **contract, not an open question** (spec §5.5): closed by
construction — a new silencing gate is a new :class:`SuppressionReason` member,
added deliberately, never a free-form string. Every span carries at minimum
``{reason, component, trace_id, span_id, tick}`` so ``/lifemodel debug`` (whose
source of truth is the structural logs / event sink, §5.6) can always answer
"why did the being stay silent?".

A span here is the LOGICAL correlation unit materialised as a structured event:
it joins the span tree through the deciding component's already-bound
:class:`~lifemodel.log.SpanBoundLogger` (over that component's child
:class:`~lifemodel.ports.tracer.ActiveSpan`), and it is *self-explaining* — the
``reason`` + decision values land on the span's attribute bag and the emitting
logger self-stamps the correlation ids onto the durable record. Best-effort OTel
export of child/suppression spans is a separate, later concern (the current
exporter ships only the root).

    Extending the set is a deliberate act — add a member here; there is no
    stringly-typed escape hatch, so an undocumented reason cannot leak.

    Members (the gate each names):

    * ``BELOW_THRESHOLD`` — the contact vital ``u`` had not crossed the absolute
      wake threshold (no reason to speak).
    * ``IN_FLIGHT`` — a proactive turn is already outstanding (idempotency).
    * ``PENDING_PROACTIVE`` — a sent turn awaits its act-gate read-back.
    * ``SILENCE_WINDOW`` — a real exchange happened too recently (inside the
      post-contact quiet window ``W``); not lonely enough to reach.
    * ``DECLINE_BACKOFF`` — a prior outreach was rejected and the growing decline
      backoff ``R`` is still active (don't drum).
    * ``ENERGY_UNAFFORDABLE`` — the cognition launch could not reserve energy.
    * ``BACKSTOP_RATE_LIMITED`` — the fail-closed delivery backstop held fire.
    * ``REPEAT_PURE_LONGING`` — the pure-longing anti-repeat contract held fire
      (unobtrusiveness preserved, concern kept, baroque machinery shed).
    * ``ACT_GATE_SILENT`` — the async Hermes turn returned ``[SILENT]`` (a
      conscious verdict, logged — not a random break).
    * ``EGRESS_UNAVAILABLE`` — no delivery channel was wired/available.
    * ``EGRESS_FAILED`` — delivery was attempted and failed at the boundary.
    * ``BIRTH_PROMPT_IN_USE`` — an UNBORN being would have had to end a live
      conversation to be born into a prompt that actually holds it (lm-4fv.4), and
      somebody is using that conversation. Held, not lost: the desire stays active
      and the next tick asks again.

    Call this from inside the deciding component (its *logger* is already bound to
    that component's child :class:`~lifemodel.ports.tracer.ActiveSpan`, so the
    emitted event joins the span tree). It does three things, making the span
    *self-explaining* rather than a bare event:

    1. drops ``reason`` + any *extra* decision values onto ``logger.span`` (the
       ``trace_spans.attrs_json`` bag — spec §4.1);
    2. closes the span with *status* (``"suppressed"`` for a gate that held fire,
       ``"failed"`` for a component fault the CoreLoop converts here);
    3. emits the canonical ``suppression`` event through *logger*, which self-stamps
       the span's ``trace_id``/``span_id``/``tick`` — so the durable record carries
       the whole :data:`SUPPRESSION_MIN_FIELDS` contract without the caller passing
       correlation ids by hand.

    Structural note: *logger* is a :class:`~lifemodel.log.SpanBoundLogger` — a
    suppression without an active span is impossible by signature, matching the §5
    invariant that a log/decision without a span cannot exist.

    **Choke-point metric (telemetry-core §4.2, bead lm-fib.7.4).** This is the ONE
    birthplace of every suppression span — in-tick (a component gate, a component
    fault) and out-of-tick (the proactive/egress backstop, the async act-gate
    verdict). When a *metrics* registry is supplied, bump
    ``lifemodel_suppressions_total{component,reason}`` HERE so the count can never
    diverge from the trace. Emission is fail-open (the registry never raises), so a
    suppression is recorded whether or not metrics are wired; *metrics* is ``None``
    in a bare unit test and off a hand-built graph.
