"""Composition root — the one place the object graph is wired (HLA §13, DI).

Clean architecture with dependency injection means exactly one module knows how
the pieces fit together. :func:`build_lifemodel` takes the injectable
dependencies (a state ``base_dir``, plus optional clock / delivery / neurons /
aggregator / bus / state overrides) and returns an assembled :class:`LifeModel`.
Everything the core needs arrives through its constructor; nothing reaches out
for a global.

Two call sites this must serve (roadmap 0.4):

* :func:`lifemodel.register` — wires the graph with **real Hermes adapters**
  (the gateway ``DeliveryPort``, constructed at the plugin boundary and injected
  in). Those Hermes-touching adapters are built *there*, not here.
* the cron ``--script`` entrypoint (task 1.1) — wires it from a ``base_dir`` and
  takes the Hermes-free defaults below.

For Phase 0.4 the defaults are the concrete :class:`SystemClock`,
:class:`JsonStateStore`, and durable :class:`FileSignalBus`, with a
:class:`NoopDelivery` stub for the ``DeliveryPort``. Note the Phase-1.4 *proactive*
outbound does **not** go through this port: on a wake the tick prints
``wakeAgent: true`` and Hermes' cron delivers the woken turn's message via the
gateway (``deliver``, HLA §7/D4). The ``DeliveryPort`` stays the seam for a future
*direct*-from-cognition delivery path, so ``NoopDelivery`` remains the default.
Phase 1.3 replaced the pass-through aggregator with the
real :class:`ThresholdAggregator`, which wakes once the accumulated pressure
crosses its threshold (:class:`SilentAggregator` stays available for tests that
want a guaranteed-quiet graph). Phase 1.2 landed the first neuron: the default
neuron list
is now a single :class:`StubTimerNeuron`, so every default graph accumulates
pressure each tick (real behavioural neurons arrive in Phase 2+). The graph
therefore constructs and is exercisable end-to-end now, and later tasks fill in
implementations rather than reshape the wiring.

Passing ``neurons`` explicitly — including an empty ``()`` — opts out of that
default, so real Hermes wiring and the seam tests stay in full control.

**This module imports no Hermes** — only Hermes-free adapters and the core — so
the whole graph is constructible (and testable) with injected fakes off-host.
